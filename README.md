Stroke Rehabilitation MatLab Application

## Asbstract


Through the combined use of microcontrollers, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, and flex sensors, we fully processed and mapped arm and hand motion. This technology will be able to provide doctors with a cost-effective, quantitative data analysis tool to aid in the rehabilitation  of stroke patients suffering hemiparesis. The development of our graphically engaging, and interactive software was apportioned into three main components: data collection, data transfer, and data analysis and visualization. Data collection encompasses the mechanical development of our hand and arm sensor system. Data transfer is the reading and streaming of data from our various sensors. Our system compares the patient’s healthy and affected arms, in order to provide a comparison that elaborates on the severity and effects of the hemiparesis. Data visualization and analysis includes the software which collects and stores a patient’s motion, and the User Interface that doctors can interact with in order to graphically visualize and analyze the stored motion. We have worked to create an integrated, low-cost, and modular system which will hopefully be beneficial to the rehabilitation of stroke patients with hemiparesis. Our ultimate goal is to create a wireless, affordable, accurate, and unrestricted full body motion capture suit.
